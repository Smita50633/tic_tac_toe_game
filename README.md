# tic_tac_toe_game
This repository contains a simple, console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. The game is designed for two players, where they take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to place three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

#Features:
2D Array Representation: The game board is represented using a 3x3 2D array.
User Input Handling: Players input their moves by selecting the row and column, with input validation to ensure correct and valid moves.
Turn-Based Play: The game alternates turns between two players ('X' and 'O'), ensuring that only valid moves are accepted.
Simple and Clear UI: The board is printed in the console after each move, displaying the updated game state.
Win/Loss/Draw Detection: The game can be extended to include logic for detecting wins, losses, or draws.
